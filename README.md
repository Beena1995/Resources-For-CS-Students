20. For interview prep try these https://www.interviewbit.com  , https://www.interviewbit.com , https://coderbyte.com , https://www.hackerrank.com ,  https://www.pramp.com 
21. Make sure your LinkedIn profile has a photo and is to some extent filled and up-to-date (e.g. work experience, voluntarily works, education), if you are looking for a job, state it in your headline. I leave mine here for an example: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mona-jalal/ also, use the the opportunities on campus to take part in LinkedIn profile enhancement which usually is followed by a professional photography session
22. Check a list of upcoming scholarships and awards by CRA here https://cra.org/cra-wp/scholarships-and-awards/other 
23. You can learn skills via Udacity, Coursera, Udemy, edx and also get a cerificate of completion. Many of these are currently having free classes due to the current pandemic.
24. You can attend conferences as a volunteer without having a paper in them. That usually waives the registration fee and helps you get a good idea about the conference. For example check SIGGRAPH student volunteering: https://s2020.siggraph.org/submissions/student-volunteers-submissions 
25. If you are a Ph.D. student, itâ€™s a good idea to have both ResearchGate (https://www.researchgate.net)  and Academia.edu (https://www.academia.edu) profiles so you would see who reads your research papers, recommends it, and interacts with it. 


If you have any questions please create an issue and I will responde. If you have other resources to share, please add them as an issue and I will add them to the list.
